##errors to handle
+ local storage
  + get
  + set

+ unable to use database
  + get
  + set

##done
+ too many bookmarks selected
+ unable to send to pushbullet
  + offline
  + pushbullet error
+ unable to find api_key cookie
+ see why database only stores 1 link when pushed. Maybe there is a way to bulk write?. We should perform the bulk write after the view is refreshed.

##ideas

+ re-write using react
